# Gym-Churn-Analysis
Gyms have a difficulty with customer churn, since it is not always clear if a customer is no longer a customer - if he or her quit. Sometimes the customer might take an affirmative action to suspend his or her membership (e.g. by shutting down their accounts or not renewing their contract once it runs out). However, sometimes it's not that clear cut. Sometimes they just disappear - poof!  In this analysis I will analyze a sample of the gym chain Model Fitness's digitized customer profiles for the purpose of finding a customer retention strategy for the chain.
